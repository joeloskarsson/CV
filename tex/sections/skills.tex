\section*{Specific Skills and Knowledge}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extensive knowledge of modern \textbf{machine learning} methods. Specific expertise in:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Probabilistic deep learning
        \item Spatio-temporal models of physical systems
        \item Bayesian models and inference methods
        \item Graph neural networks
    \end{itemize}

    \item Sound knowledge of good \textbf{software engineering} practices, acquired from my undergraduate studies and research experience.
        % I apply these practices to my research projects, creating accessible code.
        % To emphasize transparency and reproducability in research I have made a habit to release research code publicly (see \href{my github page}{https://github.com/joeloskarsson}).
