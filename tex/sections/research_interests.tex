\section*{Research Interests} %TODO
In my research I develop machine learning methods for data with spatial-, temporal- and graph-structure, including combinations of these.
I am interested in how more traditional probabilistic methods in these domains can be combined with deep learning in order to derive new methods with useful properties.
When evaluating and applying these methods to real-world problems I focus on applications within transport and vehicle systems as well as climate and weather modeling.
